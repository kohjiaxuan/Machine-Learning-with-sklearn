# Machine-Learning-with-sklearn
Practice Juypter Notebooks for my machine learning journey with Python. Previously, I have took quite a few classes on machine learning using SAS Enteprise Miner and SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning, and Machine Learning on Coursera by Prof Andrew Ng. I have also taken part in a data science competition using SAS Software in a team of 4 and managed to clinch the champion title! (links below)
